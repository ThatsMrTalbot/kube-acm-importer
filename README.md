# kube-acm-importer
Import certificates into AWS ACM from Kubernetes Secrets.

## Description

AWS Load Balancer Controller allows you to specify a certificate in ACM to sit in front of your load balancer. This is done using an annotation on the service, `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert`. In order to use this feature the certificate must first be uploaded to ACM, this controller will import certificates from Kubernetes secrets into ACM so they can be used on Kubernetes Services. It also supports adding the annotation to specified services automatically.

In this example a certificate signed using cert-manager is uploaded to ACM and used on a Service.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build the image and deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG` and `TAG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kube-acm-importer TAG=latest
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
